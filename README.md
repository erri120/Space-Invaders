# Space Invaders
Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Within the shooter genre, Space Invaders is one of the earliest shoot 'em ups and the first fixed shooter. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.
